# What is Type Casting
# Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another.
# This can be useful in various situations, such as when you need to perform operations
# between different types or when you need to format data in a specific way.
# Python has several built-in functions for type casting:
# int(): Converts a value to an integer.
# float(): Converts a value to a floating-poin
# str: Converts a value to a string.
# List, tuple(), set(), dict() and bool()
